// # Theme path
// ---------------
// The $theme-path variable should be relative to the compiled style.css file,
// so if the compiled CSS file is in a subfolder (e.g. /css/components) then the
// generated paths might be wrong in such files.
$theme-path: '..' !default;
$font-path: '#{$theme-path}/fonts' !default;
$svg-path: '#{$theme-path}/icons' !default;
